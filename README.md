# Virtual Operating System with Go and Fyne

Welcome to the Virtual Operating System project, a comprehensive desktop environment simulation built using Go and the Fyne toolkit. This project demonstrates how to create a functional and visually appealing virtual operating system with multiple integrated applications.

## Overview

This project uses Go, a powerful and efficient programming language, along with Fyne, a modern UI toolkit for building cross-platform applications. The virtual operating system includes several applications, each providing different functionalities:

- **Calculator**: A simple calculator application with basic arithmetic operations.
- **Weather App**: A weather application that displays current weather conditions and forecasts.
- **Gallery**: An image viewer application that allows users to browse and view images from a specified directory.
- **Text Editor**: A text editor with file open/save capabilities and basic text editing features.
- **Clock**: A digital clock displaying the current time with a user interface.

## Features

- **Multi-Application Interface**: Seamlessly switch between various applications using a tabbed interface.
- **Customizable Layout**: The operating system's layout can be customized with different themes and backgrounds.
- **User-Friendly Design**: All applications are designed with a clean and intuitive user interface.
- **Cross-Platform**: Built with Fyne, which ensures compatibility across different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-os.git
    cd virtual-os
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

    Ensure you have Go installed on your machine. Install the necessary Go modules:

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:

    Execute the main application file to start the virtual operating system:

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

4. **Explore**:

    Use the interface to explore the various applications. Click on the buttons to launch the calculator, weather app, gallery, text editor, and clock.
